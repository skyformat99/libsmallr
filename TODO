1) Make it work.
    * Draw out a plan for the compiled representation.
    - Code the constructs to represent said compiled form.
    - Implement it:
        -- Create function library?
        -- Use as few functions as necessary.

3) Internals.
    - Character classes.
        * Almost done, doesn't support nests.

2) Make it a library.
    - Update Makefile
    - Update functions/loaders.
